# AddMusicKFF
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/a54kb6tfh9r8m4wl?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/KungFuFurby/addmusickff)

This is a fork created by KungFuFurby off of AddMusicK 1.0.8, originally by Kipernal and since version 1.0.6 updated by various other users (specifically Medic, HertzDevil, Vitor, Lui, KevinM and KungFuFurby).

This repository hosts changes made by KungFuFurby to AddMusicK for others to test, especially if they eventually get merged into the official AddMusicK.

You can find the latest Windows build (particularly if you need C++-side modifications) [here](http://www.atarismwc.com/amkff_releases/).
